# Elevate Lab Internship
# Task1 : Creating a command-line calculator supporting basic operations ( +, -, *, /)
# Below are the points which I learned from the calculator project
- Creating a separate **function** for each operations
- learned to use **try/except** block for handling erors, like invalid input from user (inserting letter instead of number), division by zero
- to take input from user, used **input()** function
- to handle different math operation, used **if-elif-else** conditions
- to keep the calculator running until the user types exit, used **while True** loop
- used if __name__ == "__main__" to keep script, safe, clean & professional
